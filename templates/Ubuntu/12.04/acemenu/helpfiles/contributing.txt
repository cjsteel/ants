============

As part of our open science initiative we invite you to share recommendations
of commands that you have you found to be helpful in your work. You may 
contribute them via the GLPI ticketing system or by emailing a member of
the ACElabs IT team.

Include the name of the command or concept as well as any options you have 
found to be particualrly helpful.

A short help that fits in a single terminal screen, such as this one, would
be greatfully appreciated as well.

Regards,

The ACElabs IT, Research and Development Teams
